# Assignment from a course in data structures and algorithms
I wrote the file FifthElement.h
I removed the testing files as those were written by my professor.
It was an activity to practice using lists. 
I created methods to: return the fifth element in a list, 
 insert a new element to be the fifth element (fourth index), delete the fifth element, and switch the fourth and fifth elements. All of these methods utilize template functions and use pointers to #assign positions to different elements.
